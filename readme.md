# ðŸ’¡ Customer Churn Prediction

This project trains and evaluates multiple machine learning models to predict customer churn in a subscription-based business using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The goal is to identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscription (churn), allowing the company to take preventive actions.

The project includes:
- Data cleaning and exploration
- Feature engineering
- Model training with hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Model evaluation and visualization
- Modular pipeline structure for reproducibility

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

Source: [Kaggle â€“ Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

The dataset includes:
- Demographics: Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents
- Services: Phone, Internet, Streaming, etc.
- Account info: Tenure, Contract, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges
- Target: `Churn`

## ðŸ§  Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each model is trained with `GridSearchCV` and evaluated using:
- F1 Score
- ROC AUC
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
